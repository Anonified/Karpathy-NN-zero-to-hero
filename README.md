# ðŸ§  Karpathy's Neural Networks: Zero to Hero â€“ Implementation

This repository is my personal implementation of **Andrej Karpathy's "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero" lecture series**.  
The goal is to deeply understand neural networks by building everything from scratch â€” without relying on high-level frameworks â€” and then gradually moving towards modern tools like PyTorch.
